# Learning Python through projects

## About

A collection of several [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects for the developers eager to learn and increment their programming abilities. Keep in mind these projects are more focused in beginners and intermediate programmers, and although the projects are easy to understand, read and replicate, they introduce you to a variety of libraries, functions and ways to use the Python programming language in order to create code.

You can also enter to my Youtube channel and watch my videos explaining the creation of each of the projects that lay here if you want an easier and more dynamic way of understanding the code.

## Feeling like contributing?

This repository is continously being filled with more projects, so stay tunned for future updates and feel free to issue any problems and improvements you might discover.

## References

This repository contains the source code and its compilation of several projects stated in the **Python** part of the [Project Based Learning repository](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#python) so please refer to that repository if you want to search up even more projects you can try to build.
